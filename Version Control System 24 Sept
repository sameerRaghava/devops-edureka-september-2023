Version Control System

Git --> Version control system (VCS)
GitHub --> Source Code Management (SCM) / Online Code Repo  --> Remote Repo


Why VCS?
1. To track changes --> who commited the changes? what was the change? --> commit id
2. To retrieve/recover files from accidental deletes

2 types of VCS:
1. Centralized VCS --> svn (subversion)
    Drawbacks:
      a. Multiple developers can't work on the same files/projects at the same time
      b. To make changes, Developers need to be connected over the internet

2. Distributed VCS --> git

===========================================================================================
ls -la --> list the hidden files/directories --> To check whether the folder is being tracked bt git or not (.git)
ls -l --> WD
git ls-files --> SA/LR
git status --> To confirm SA or LR
      untracked --> WD
      chnages to be committed --> SA
      working tree clean --> LR
